<br>
<h1>About</h1>
<p>The Logs Analysis project is the 3rd project of the Full Stack Nanodegree program from Udacity. 
   It is a program written in Python 3 that sends three specific PostgreSQL queries to a large news website database 
   (containing over a million rows of data through 3 multicolumned tables) and returns the results in 
   a reader-friendly format. Each query is dynamic in that they require the joining of tables or the 
   use of views to return complex answers from many different units of data within the database.</p>
